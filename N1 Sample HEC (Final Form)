This is a example of a final product of a JSON script for creating a valid webhook request:

The activities can be modified for your teams specific use case on what activity logs you want sent to the webhook
The expand can be modified for what key details you want included in the activity log that is sent. 
The value should retain the "splunk" but should have your own unique key added for the autentication. 
Leave the URL endpoint as is.
